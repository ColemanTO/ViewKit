## work in progress -- still very beta

ViewKit is a fork of [UIKit](http://github.com/visionmedia/uikit) designed for mobile WebKit WebViews. Compatible with iOS4.2+ and Android 2.3+ browsers

Sorry for the lack of documentation! I'm still working on this project


## using this

- install http://github.com/jorgebastida/glue
- compile and package into `build/` with `make`

## examples

here are a couple of apps I wrote that use ViewKit:
